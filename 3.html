      (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
      is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
      webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
      browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users'
      devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
      that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
      working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
      and the Document Object Model (DOM)..
