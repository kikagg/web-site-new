      or HTML is the <strong>standard markup language</strong> for documents
      designed to be displayed in a <u>web</u> browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
      or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
      included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
      building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
      objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

      HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
      structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
      quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
      using angle brackets.

      surround and provide information about document text and may include other
      tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them
      to interpret the content of the page.
